Mariah, Kevin, Raghav, Anthony
------------------------------

* Heroku + DB on VPS so we have control
* Full routing with express router
* Angular as new library? Not hard for basic stuff
* Handlebars/Angular/Pug for template engine
* Authentication with the DB
* Migration strategy would be allowing people to the backend with a full API, remote connecting with workbench?
